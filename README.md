# Data-Analysis---Montgomery-Fleet-Inventory
Fleet Inventory: Data Cleaning and Visualisation
# Project Overview

As a newly hired Junior Data Analyst for a local government office, I was tasked with cleaning and preparing inventory data for the fleet of vehicles used by various departments. This task was crucial to ensure the data was accurate, consistent, and ready for analysis.

# The aim

This project's main objective was to clean and standardise a dataset that had been in raw, comma-separated value (CSV) format until now. This required resolving problems such uneven formatting, redundant records, and inaccurate data.

## Steps Taken

# File Conversion:
The provided CSV file was converted into an Excel Workbook (.XLSX) format for easier manipulation and formatting.

# Column Width Adjustment:
Adjusted the widths of all columns to ensure all data was visible.

# Empty Rows Removal:
Used Excelâ€™s filter feature to identify and delete all rows with blank cells.

# Duplicate Records Removal:
Applied the Remove Duplicates feature to eliminate any redundant records.

# Spelling Corrections:
Identified and corrected spelling errors in the dataset to ensure consistency.

# Whitespace Removal:
Used the Find and Replace feature to remove unnecessary spaces from the data.

# Department Name Standardisation:
Combined department names, which were split across two columns, into a single column using the Flash Fill feature.
Removed the original split columns after combining.


# TOOLS USED 
Excel for the Web: Performed all tasks using the free web version of Excel.
Built-in Excel Features: Utilised features such as AutoFilter, Remove Duplicates, Flash Fill, and Find and Replace.
